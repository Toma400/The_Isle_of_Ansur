# What Is Baedoor?
## Short overview

Baedoor is fantasy/steampunk/sci-fi world being created by me (Toma400 aka Tomasz Stępień in real life) since around 2004. It is parted into different continents, each having different civilisations, traditions, culture and impact on universe. Its history has about 4 thousands years and three eras, which range from ancient/medieval fantasy theme ("Pre-Era"), through late medieval and early steampunk ("Old Era") to late steampunk and some dieselpunk influences ("New Era"). 

This is how you can label my universe within typical scheme, if you want to. I'd personally suggest reading some of my personal notes further to understand why I perceive that differently, but of course, labelling has its advantages and rights (especially as Baedoor was never made out of context and it was strongly influenced by many games, books, music and other things I enjoyed at the time). If you want to hear my story, read on.

## Author's perspective

Since that world became my obsession and life-long journey, I prefer to name myself an "archaeologist" of it, not the creator: just because creation process had several parts, ranging from my extreme childhood (I was 7 y/o when I started) to now. Therefore now, when I try to make Baedoor universe more public and organised, I do not only need to fill the holes of what I created recently, but I also discover my neverending notes from childhood, being written in dozens of notebooks. A lot of this knowledge I have forgotten and I rediscover it now, making me feel like I no longer create my universe: I encounter it by dreaming about it and find traces of elder civilisations living in the times when I didn't really have consciousness of what I'm doing. Or did I? I will never fully know. And I feel like it truly makes it beautiful, shaping my person in more thoughtful way than it would do being written from scratch.
I'm now sharing it with you, with hope that you will find your place in universe that I, fully understanding what that word means, can call my forever home.

# What Is Baedoor RPG System
Baedoor RPG system is kinda classic in terms of gameplay: it allows you to do exactly similar things as most RPG systems, meaning you can fight, develop your character and follow the story, which depends on your choices and statistics. It never tried to be anything hugely distinct or original, as - as a player - I really enjoyed classic RPG systems. And this RPG system was initially created to maintain myself (more on that in [short history section](baedoor.md#short-history-of-baedoor-universe-and-rpg-system) below) and within really specific technical boundaries (notebook-based RPG). Therefore its first version was distinct by its almost limitless possibilities, but losing on more stable, official RPG system, and making each game really long, even with just small amount of progress done. But that immersion supported by my own mind was making up for it greatly.

This was also what I found the most interesting in my own gameplay - that detailed care about smallest details, such as being open for player's imagination. It allows just skipping minutes on sitting in tavern, or go anywhere in borders of programmed locations and do almost anything. Including also one of the most neglected sides of RPG genre: simulation (partly introduced in several games, such as house buying in Skyrim, Tibia, or general concept of The Sims). This means that you can just wander from house to house and sell coal, because, well, each house has its own fireplace and uses coal with each day passing. And coal mine nearby still needs someone who would transport and sell their mined resources.
Of course, since Baedoor games were from the ground really minimalistic technically (original ones had side-view perspective), a lot of this system were left for imagination. Just like classic paper RPGs, on which Baedoor was just variation with its own specifics: having notebooks with each location drawn and separate notebooks for each location data. If you want to perceive it that way, it tried to merge cRPGs and paper RPGs.

# Short History of Baedoor Universe and RPG System
Baedoor RPG System was firstly introduced in three games introduced by me in my childhood, when I liked to create my own paper-based games and started creating Baedoor Universe. They didn't have strict name, being forever "work in progress" in fact, but I refer to them as "Lands", "Other Lands" and "Baedoor" (being made around 2004, 2005 and 2008, but these dates can differ, being ~year earlier/later, I don't remember that precisely).

First game introduced mostly universe - being, in fact, strategy with loose rules, where player hold power over Ghlodd Empire and several other civilisations. Second game was basically the same as first one, but it was done not on notebooks, but cardboard, using plasticine.
Third game, from which whole system and universe take name from, introduced more RPG-aimed alternative for first one. It took place in - in that time - separate world, introducing whole Baedoor continent. For roleplay purposes, RPG system has been made, but it was aimed to be very open for player's initiative: player was both Game Master and Player, therefore all actions was dependent on him and his will - rules were just small guides to be followed, but not strictly, if that contradicted player's will.

There was several iterations of Baedoor RPG games introduced by that time, each one showed also new lands (respectively: Baedoor Island, WesternWald, Vershation Highlands, Northern Isles, Arennan, Rossevette). They didn't change RPG system a lot though, so we can say about versions such as 1.0, 1.1 etc. Eventually, since I felt bound to the universe more and more, I decided to merge separate universes (Baedoor, Ghlodd Empires, Old Continent, and so on) into one, making it only one universe with separate continents. This, again, wasn't decision which I fully perceive as mine, because in all "universes" I tried to refer to older and newer ones, so merging them seemed rather as logical consequence of my previous path. Lore-wise it even helped that universe, making it more consistent. But, as the decision was mostly caused by me trying to write more mature stories within the universe, it also helped with that a lot. In the meantime, New Era was born. It became main era of me using the universe, since I didn't feel that writing brutal or depressing stories in this era will destroy what I once created, being a bit more innocent (eventually it didn't matter, since newer stories take place in various eras and lands, but it mattered for me at the time).

The real change for RPG system came in similar time, with Between Shadows and Lights, being my study project to pass lessons. It was written in Python in 2018, using most basic elements of it, such as condition and loops. Nevertheless, for the first time, it tried to conclude Baedoor RPG system within some real boundaries. It suffered from my coding knowledge though, so it resulted in scrapping a lot of ideas, just to make system playable. This is, in historic view, Baedoor RPG System 2.0: very limited and poorly introduced, but definitely more official take on what was limitless before. 

BSaL was rewritten after half of a year, but since it was only a bit more stable and code-advanced, it was early abandoned due to frequent crashes and lack of motivation. None of these scrapped features were actually introduced back in 2.0. Both 1.0 and 2.0 version weren't publicly available, though, since first one wasn't made for public use, and second one was extremely badly made and could be declassified easily by any other similar game. Rewritten BSaL, though, was fully done in terms of completeness: you could actually visit Ansur Isle, do quests, fight, create your character. It also had its .exe file with amateurish icon. But even if I would like to publish it, language barrier was a thing, since it was written entirely in Polish.

Baedoor universe then became my universe where I tried to write stories more frequently: abandoning cRPG ideas, I decided to focus on stories, which I had written before, but never finished. In late 2019, I wrote short story called "Wolf", which told a story about outlaw gunslinger being lost on Vershaton deserts. It was purely experimental piece of paper, being terrible in technical side, but very personal and I perceive it as one of the most straightforward prose I wrote. Experimental style also lead it to become almost "art cinema" style of uncertainty of interpretation, which I always see as an artistic success, even if poorly made.
In the same time, I also expanded some universe aspects - both by finding old notebooks with notes, and by writing it from scratch (such as West of Moon Continent, which history is strongly inspired by historical book on Japan I read back then). It led to Ghlodds having its distinct, really weird language, in which I even tried to write some lore-based poetry, using the name of poet Nansaai Narayana (and somehow, I also included it in "real-life" poetry, such as in [this poem](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B0GTSDmfjdpSsHbKb8AJquiE6ezEEctf/view?usp=sharing) which uses Ghloddish title).

The last part of Baedoor universe expansion - by the time I write this - came with [Wastelands of Baedoor](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wastelands-of-baedoor) mod for Minecraft, made in MCreator in 2020, and remade from early 2021. The idea appeared mostly from me being frustrated that you can't farm sand in vanilla game, but it quickly expanded to several other features I wanted to include in my mod. After all, I decided to make it bound to my universe, since I tend to do that all the time with a lot of my creations. It also helped me with deciding which features and items should go into WoB, because Baedoor universe had grounded features for a lot of time - my work was only to make it Minecraft-friendly.

Once WoB got released and I received positive feedback on it, I decided to part it into at least three pieces, explaining in more detailed way the lore, and including mechanics that would make WoB unbearably huge mod other way. And since I felt burned out lately, I decided to also renew BSaL - making use of my modding experience from past year. To make it distinct, I decided to go with new name: The Isle of Ansur. IoA is, though, fully what I wanted BSaL to be, so calling it just "Between Shadows and Lights: The Isle of Ansur" is not a mistake. I can make another isles available as vanilla expansions for this game, so it is possible that I will use new titles as add-on names. As of now, Baedoor creations can be listed as such:
* [2004] Lands `not official`
* [2005] Other Lands `not official`
* [2008] Baedoor `not official`
* [2018] Between Shadows and Lights `not official`
* [2021] [Wastelands of Baedoor](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wastelands-of-baedoor)
* [2021] Between Shadows and Lights: The Isle of Ansur `upcoming`
* [2021] Spires of Baedoor `upcoming`
* [2021] Civilisations of Baedoor `upcoming`

After all, Baedoor universe now became something public, which I find both terrifying and exciting. I will try to show you as much of this universe as I can, and I hope that you will find yourself excited to wander on its lands and do whatever you like - even if it's just "another fantasy/steampunk world". Or maybe you find yourself seeing this universe as something close to your heart, as I do.

# Overview - what's new, what's old
Baedoor RPG System 3.0, written exclusively for IoA, tries to cross the limits of version 2.0 and introduce as many features of 1.0 as it is possible within rational use (so, that it won't burn your memory card). It is take on finding a balance between freedom and different platform limtations, being PC.

## Statistics
Statistics were always huge part of Baedoor RPG system, but the power they hold over character was pretty small, making them kinda aesthetical. Version 3.0 tries to focus more on statistics dependency, making game more intuitive for any RPG player - systems of crafting and abilities are expanded, allowing player to feel more power with developed character. In the same time, 3.0 comes back to idea integrated in 1.0 system and abandoned in version 2.0: actual action also make you learn skills, making your development not as strict as 2.0 version was (initially introduced in BSaL). You can remember such system from Elder Scrolls series, and it is basically the same thing.
Smaller amount of statistics from 2.0 is kept, though, because 1.0 version - being loosely dependent on them - could make skill for almost any action you took (it counted more than 200 skills being in games using 1.0 system).

## World
Version 1.0 took place in both Pre-Era and Old Era, depending on game using it. Since version 2.0, times have changed and new version is following that path. Even further, as version 3.0 enables you to have realistic systems within game (again 1.0 parity), such as real time, in IoA exclusively you will be able to be in exact time as in Baedoor (being year 921NE, for year 2021 in our universe). All game events will take that time boundaries in mind, referencing to it with past and current events.
This is why I recommend playing realistic game mode in IoA once it is finished: you will be able to not only immerse with the game fully, but also follow events by checking magazines and having actual knowledge of lore.

## Mechanics
Previously mentioned realistic mode makes you more bound to 1.0 system, but as a choice. You can enable each element of it separately:
* Realistic Time - makes game time exact time of our world. So: if you have time-limited quest, such as nighttime robbery, you need to wait for night, or to change your PC clock time. This system is the most gamechanging one, since it also affects sleeping and some exclusive features.
* Hunger/Thirst - additional system, requiring you to drink and eat regularly
* Permanent Death - will lock your save after death

Other than that, 2.0 systems are rewritten, trying to aim for less complicated, but more playful fights, and addition of new elements such as crafting, which weren't in BSaL originally.

## Freedom
Last but not least, version 3.0 will focus on giving player as much freedom as they would want. It is still limited by my coding knowledge, but now it tries to avoid some basic problems BSaL had. Suggestions on what you will like to be added are very welcome (and can be specified in "issues" tab of this GitHub)

# Future
I do not know where future will lead me with my projects - whether they will be my free time stuff or something I do more "officially". For now, I will try to finish my current projects (WoB, CoB, SoB, IoA). There may come some English poems or stories within this universe too, although I can't guarantee that, since I don't feel as thoughtful writing in English language. I also plan to write several Baedoor-related concept music albums.

In my dreams, there's idea of proper cRPG game, being in vein of Arcanum: Of Steampunk and Magick Obscura, or even Skyrim... but that's just loose idea for the future. When I have enough money, coding knowledge, maybe even people helping me with this project. But I'd love to make such big, sandbox game based on Baedoor universe. This is partly why I decided to make IoA.

And this is the end of our journey, but I'm glad I took it. I hope you too. As lunatris would say farewell: "take care, my brother!"
