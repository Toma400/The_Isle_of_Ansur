# Welcome to the The Isle of Ansur wiki!
Here is some documentation I readded to native game files just to make sure it will
be available for anyone playing it, in any time. It will contain eventually all needed 
information on what Baedoor is, lore, and modding support added by vanilla.

In case you have any questions, feel free to contact me on

The Isle of Ansur is successor (and, in the same time, remake) of 
Between Shadows and Lights game, which was too crappy programmed to be released publicly. 
Remake of it will try to polish and expand all features of the BSaL, 
allowing you to feel the depth of that text-based sandbox RPG game. 
It is also based on newly created Baedoor RPG 3.0 system, 
which is most refined version of it, adding several tweaks and new features.

### Story

But your travel is disrupted by storm that forces the ship to dock to the island being 
exactly half-way to your destination: the island called Ansur. 
You can also read [detailed history of the world](lore/background.md).
