## Ansur Isle
Ansur is baedoorian island with some autonomic power once Baedoor Empire fallen and split into Eastern and Western Empires. It is considered trade point between East side of Moon Continent and Anahsahei.

## Short History
Ansur were discovered during Exodus, which separated Old Era and New Era of Baedoor universe and caused Baedoor Empire to fall. During Exodus, a lot of panicked citizens travelled far away from Baedoor Continent (currently: Anahsahei) into the west. They eventually found Moon Continent, settling themselves on its east coast, but before that, Ansur were found and people from two ships settled in it, building first town called Evros.

After many years, Ansur started making profits from its "exactly in half" position between Anahsahei and new creating empires on East Coast of Moon continent. Since Baedoor Empire split itself in half and lost most of their territories, both parts of past Empire needed to trade with other countries. For any ship-based trading, Ansur was perfect place to stock up and dock in safe place at night. It made from Ansur island a bit richer place. In the same time, vinyard part of the island started becoming second city, making Ansur another great exporter of grapevines.

## Current Times

In the same time, though, great rumours take place on other side. Magazines tell about Mrran discovering new totalitarian ideology and coming to power... protests are going in current capital of the East, New Baedoor city. Knowing that, you even more happily decided to stay on Ansur for a while.
