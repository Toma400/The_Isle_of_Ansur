# Modding Documentation
This is main modding documentation for the project, made in a way that may not be
the most clear to the end user, but which will eventually be made into proper document
when systems are more stable.

The doc is meant to be more of a personal reference for myself, and to be most up-to-date
(unlike user-friendly approaches which take much more time to update usually).
