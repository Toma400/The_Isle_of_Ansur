# THE ISLE OF ANSUR END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

---

This document states precise rules for using The Isle of Ansur game, 
as well as obey license for both The Isle of Ansur game and Baedoor RPG System 3.0+, 
included in this product. 

By playing The Isle of Ansur or creating any game-related content, 
you agree on that license. Full version of it is placed in main folder of the game.

If the action is not stated in End User License Agreement (later: EULA) or license, 
therefore is by default not allowed. 
In case you have interest on it being allowed, contact the author and include 
your proposal. It can be considered for further changing of EULA. 
Author restricts the right to change EULA in any time, and new laws coming 
with that change apply immediately.

Actions called as `Beneficial actions` later in EULA relate to any action which
is beneficial for sub-author (user or creator using franchise). This does only
partly apply to publishing platforms and differ from context: if said platform
is the only way of sub-author to share their art (such as authors publishing entirety
of their art on Discord servers), joining such server is not considered as "beneficial
action" per se. 
Though, if sub-author has varied platforms on which they publish,
some sort of access is required, without forcing users to join platform.
If such platform entering requires user to pay, though, it is considered as "beneficial
action" no matter the publishing principles of sub-author.
