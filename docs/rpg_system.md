# Baedoor RPG System

Baedoor RPG system is kinda classic in terms of gameplay: 
it allows you to do exactly similar things as most RPG systems, meaning you can fight, 
develop your character and follow the story, which depends on your choices and statistics. 
It never tried to be anything hugely distinct or original, as - as a player - I really 
enjoyed classic RPG systems. And this RPG system was initially created to maintain myself 
and within really specific technical boundaries (notebook-based RPG). 
Therefore its first version was distinct by its almost limitless possibilities, 
but losing on more stable, official RPG system, and making each game really long, 
even with just small amount of progress done. But that immersion supported by my own 
mind was making up for it greatly.

This was also what I found the most interesting in my own gameplay - that detailed care 
about smallest details, such as being open for player's imagination. It allows just 
skipping minutes on sitting in tavern, or go anywhere in borders of programmed locations
and do almost anything. Including also one of the most neglected sides of RPG genre: 
simulation (partly introduced in several games, such as house buying in Skyrim, Tibia, 
or general concept of The Sims). 
This means that you can just wander from house to house and sell coal, because, well, 
each house has its own fireplace and uses coal with each day passing. 
And coal mine nearby still needs someone who would transport 
and sell their mined resources.
Of course, since Baedoor games were from the ground really minimalistic technically 
(original ones had side-view perspective), a lot of this system were left for imagination.
Just like classic paper RPGs, on which Baedoor was just variation with its own 
specifics: having notebooks with each location drawn and separate notebooks for each 
location data. If you want to perceive it that way, it tried to merge cRPGs and paper RPGs.

# 3.0 Overview - what's new, what's old
Baedoor RPG System 3.0, written exclusively for IoA, tries to cross the limits of version 2.0 and introduce as many features of 1.0 as it is possible within rational use (so, that it won't burn your memory card). It is take on finding a balance between freedom and different platform limtations, being PC.

## Statistics
Statistics were always huge part of Baedoor RPG system, but the power they hold over character was pretty small, making them kinda aesthetical. Version 3.0 tries to focus more on statistics dependency, making game more intuitive for any RPG player - systems of crafting and abilities are expanded, allowing player to feel more power with developed character. In the same time, 3.0 comes back to idea integrated in 1.0 system and abandoned in version 2.0: actual action also make you learn skills, making your development not as strict as 2.0 version was (initially introduced in BSaL). You can remember such system from Elder Scrolls series, and it is basically the same thing.
Smaller amount of statistics from 2.0 is kept, though, because 1.0 version - being loosely dependent on them - could make skill for almost any action you took (it counted more than 200 skills being in games using 1.0 system).

## World
Version 1.0 took place in both Pre-Era and Old Era, depending on game using it. Since version 2.0, times have changed and new version is following that path. Even further, as version 3.0 enables you to have realistic systems within game (again 1.0 parity), such as real time, in IoA exclusively you will be able to be in exact time as in Baedoor (being year 921NE, for year 2021 in our universe). All game events will take that time boundaries in mind, referencing to it with past and current events.
This is why I recommend playing realistic game mode in IoA once it is finished: you will be able to not only immerse with the game fully, but also follow events by checking magazines and having actual knowledge of lore.

## Mechanics
Previously mentioned realistic mode makes you more bound to 1.0 system, but as a choice. You can enable each element of it separately:
* Realistic Time - makes game time exact time of our world. So: if you have time-limited quest, such as nighttime robbery, you need to wait for night, or to change your PC clock time. This system is the most gamechanging one, since it also affects sleeping and some exclusive features.
* Hunger/Thirst - additional system, requiring you to drink and eat regularly
* Permanent Death - will lock your save after death

Other than that, 2.0 systems are rewritten, trying to aim for less complicated, but more playful fights, and addition of new elements such as crafting, which weren't in BSaL originally.

## Freedom
Last but not least, version 3.0 will focus on giving player as much freedom as they would want. It is still limited by my coding knowledge, but now it tries to avoid some basic problems BSaL had. Suggestions on what you will like to be added are very welcome (and can be specified in "issues" tab of this GitHub)
