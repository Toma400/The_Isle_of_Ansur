# General Questions
## 1. How long will you maintain this game? Will you like to add new mod-supporting features once you finish it?
I can't say anything for certain as of right now, but I will try my best to maintain 
the game as long as it will have some issues I can fix. If there's any request for 
specific feature (especially mod-aimed) or pull request with code adding that without 
any issues for backcompatibility, I will also try my best to review it and introduce, 
if it would follow general game way of thinking.

## 2. How much will you add before you see IoA as "finished"?
Well, my main goal is to reintroduce whole Between Shadows and Lights content, this time
though including all mechanics being available, despite BSaL content not giving need
to utilise them all. Also, I want to make IoA having broad modding possibilities, so
I can leave IoA "as is" and be sure that people can infinitely enhance it, adding new
worlds and stories.

There's a change that I will add new modules adding new lands though, so there's a chance
that it will have way more features included and much more lore revealed with its core
gameplay.

# Technical Questions
## 1. I didn't save my game for a long time, and my game crashed/something else happened. Do I need to do everything again?
No, you don't. IoA uses constant autosave in separate directory, 
always allowing you to have "up-to-date" save files.
Go into your saved profile (it is placed in "saves/" directory and 
uses name of your profile) and find folder named "in use". 
Copy its contents outside, replacing them. 
This way you will have latest data "hardsaved" and you will be able to 
come back to it while loading the game from menu.

**Important issue though: if your game crashed during profile creation, 
I'd suggest removing the directory with save and creating new profile in-game - 
just because it means you will not get any statistics bonuses coming from 
non-choosen options. You can refer to your previous profile.json file to 
find out which gender, class or race you chosen.**

## 2. Can I use different settings on different saves?
Yes, you can. Remember though that - if you want to convert them - 
you can only convert non-realistic settings into realistic one. 
It is protection from bugs that could come from time differences and lack of 
statistics.

# Copyright Questions
## 1. I made a mod. Where can I publish it?
Anywhere you want! As a mod creator, you have full rights to publish it on any page!
EULA restricts you only to not benefit from accessing the mod, so the only requirement
for distributing IoA mods is that they have to be accessible without paying or profitting
from that. 

You can of course put donation links and such on the pages with distribution,
since users donating will not pay for product per se, but more as a support gesture for
you.
