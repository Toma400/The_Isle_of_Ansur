# Character Creation

Character creation takes main role in early game, when you need to specify your role in the world, at least slightly.
Creation of your character is built on several choices you make, which are coming in such order:

* Name
* Gender
* Race
* Class
* Manual attribute/ability bonus

***

### Name

Name is the only one choice that doesn't affect the game at all - it is important if you want to roleplay game deeper, though.

### Gender

Gender choice is minor one, but can affect your relations with some NPCs, since all people can have bias.

### Race

Race choice is dominant choice you can make in your game - even considering gameplay as a whole, both early game and late game.
Races differ not only by different set of attributes, but also by specific perks and style - and also by relationships with NPCs.
Therefore, that choice should be really thought out.

### Class

Class is second most important choice you can make, since it gives you set of ability bonuses. These can be crucial in early game,
allowing you to do some actions that you will not be able to do without them. It is also really good base for your character
development, since you don't need to grind your character as much to reach higher levels of specific ability.

### Manual attribute/ability bonus

This part gives you a bit more freedom, because it is exactly your choice to add small bonus (+1) to any ability and attribute by
yourself. The only limitation are within exclusive abilities, such as connection/necromantic magic. They possibly can be learned
after, if you are lucky enough, but there's no way to obtain some of them in this menu.
