### BASIC TECHNICAL CONCEPTS

---

###### IDs
There are several IDs in Isle of Ansur, all of them being used to differentiate
between specific elements of objects used during the game.

The ones used by far are:
* RID (Race ID)
* CID (Class ID)
* IID (Item ID)

All of these IDs follow the same pattern: each of them contain `namespace` and
`raw ID`, separated by the colon. Correct full ID looks like this:

`namespace:raw_ID`

IDs are generated dynamically with every data loading.

### MORE IN-DEPTH ELEMENTS 

---
None by far.

### GAME VERSIONING

---

Game versioning requires separate section for listing all stages.

> **PRE-ALPHA**
> 
> Version of game not really possible to be played, containing mainly not-fully-implemented 
> systems and elements that require lots of testing to be working correctly.
> 
> Released pre-alpha builds are only for later testing, and are usually unstable.<br>
> Can contain specific feature only, or game with implemented-yet features.
