# CACHE
# Cache module is served to manage cache, or rather
# store cache files. They can be safely deleted
# from here
#---------------------------------------------------
#                Important though!
#
# Folders as:
# - pyinstaller
#
# Should not be removed entirely. They are used
# for specific actions, at least in developer's
# stage. They can be cleared, though.
#
# If possible, use function cache_manag.brutedel()
# to execute deleting caches, instead of doing it
# manually.
