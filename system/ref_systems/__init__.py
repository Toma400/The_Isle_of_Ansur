# REFERENCE SYSTEMS
# This module is made directly as place for elements to be referenced
# This means that it will handle all default values of things,
# or elements that would be referenced during game as - core features -
#
# Therefore it differs from /stats/ and /worlds/ folder, as they are
# meant to be changeable. If we would code that in java, we would
# call ref_systems as :final: type of class, I guess.
