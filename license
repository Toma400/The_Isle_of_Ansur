                  THE ISLE OF ANSUR USE LICENSE
                     Version 1, 23 April 2022

This license refers broadly to The Isle of Ansur (later also: IoA)
contents, but also elements based off its lore or code.
In case you have any doubts or questions, read EULA file or FAQ
(located in /docs/ folder). EULA is basically more human-friendly
form of license, since contents of both documents are similar.

License may change in the future with next iterations.
As an owner of the license and copyrights, I will use term "we" to
describe myself.


1. GENERAL LICENSE
The Isle of Ansur contents (by that we mean code, assets, universe and
all content that is made for it by other people and published with
any association to IoA product) belong to the author.
As an author, I prohibit any use of said contents without my consent,
with exception of:

  - playing the game
  - modifying files of the game for your own purposes, without sharing
    it publicly
  - creating modifications (packs)
  - publishing modifications (packs), if they do not contradict rights
    from section 2/EULA
  - republishing the game in terms written in section 3


2. LICENSE FOR ASSOCIATED CONTENT
Software created by other people that adds or changes IoA contents is
considered as product with shared copyrights.

Author of said software has right to:

  - own their code, assets and other materials they created to be used
    within said software
  - own their rights to the software, to the limitation that:
    - they cannot do any beneficial action (term explained in EULA and
      section 4.1) with said software
    - they cannot contradict rights of IoA authors to their software

Author of IoA has right to:

  - own parent rights to the software, that being understood as to decide
    fully on its purpose (despite that right being "powertripping", it is
    not likely for us to abuse it)


3. INFOANARCHISM
Even though we use All Rights Reserved license, restricting use of IoA
drastically, we believe in infoanarchist future. We perceive it, though,
as freedom of sharing culture/art for free to anyone, not as death of
an author.
Therefore, IoA is granted you as free game for which you do not pay for.
This also means that you can republish it by yourself AS LONG AS IT DOES
NOT PROVIDE YOU ANY BENEFICIAL ACTIONS (see section 4.1).

I request though, for the person republishing it, to check if their
copy is safe (that means: free from viruses or hacking software, or any
other additions which can cause harm to the user in any way).

Final request is that republishing person should not try to impersonate
the author and explicitly state that their republishing is made on their
own - within the license, but without author's knowledge and from their
own copy, which is considered less reliable than official source.


4. ADDITIONAL GLOSSARY

4.1. Beneficial Actions
Actions called as Beneficial actions relate to any action
which is beneficial for sub-author (user or creator using franchise).
This does only partly apply to publishing platforms and differ
from context: if said platform is the only way of sub-author to share
their art (such as authors publishing entirety of their art on Discord
servers), joining such server is not considered as "beneficial action"
per se.

Though, if sub-author has varied platforms on which they publish,
some sort of access is required, without forcing users to join platform.
If such platform entering requires user to pay, though, it is considered
as "beneficial action" no matter the publishing principles of sub-author.
