# The Isle of Ansur

---
The Isle of Ansur is text-based RPG game, being remaster of my old terminal game taking place
in my own steampunk/fantasy universe, Baedoor.

Unlike original, it is made with graphical interface, trying to be accessible and much
more advanced technologically.  
Despite its oldschool character, The Isle of Ansur tries to improve on mechanics I find
too static in the genre and support modding extensively.

# Current Progress Status

---
The Isle of Ansur is currently in:

> **pre-alpha** 

This means game is not usable by any means. This doesn't mean you cannot download
developer's builds or report issues, though - it's really welcome to participate in
such early state of the game!

Current gameplay features:
- Creation of your own character (it can be saved for future updates gameplay)
- Modding support (related to character creation)

To have ~~spoilers~~ sneak-peek into development process, you can look into issues page.  
Milestones/bulk topics let me organise and discuss next steps in what I code into the game.  
Feel free to share your thoughts or report bugs there.

Currently, you can contribute to open-sourced translation mods listed in [section above](#translations).

You can reach to developer by pull request or contacting directly, but it will
most likely be rejected.
