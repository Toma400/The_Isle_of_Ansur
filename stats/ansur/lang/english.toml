races__baedoorian_descr = '''
Human race is known to be flexible and very adaptive to its environment. One of common qualities of humans is their mobility and openness to chances, making them overall great merchants and spokeperson, classic fighters, as well as technicians and mages.
What this race gains from being very fluid however, it loses on mastery. Human beings are rarely beyond bit-above-average in many aspects.
Despite those shortcomings, their assimilation skills let them be very expansive kind, inhabiting most of places in Baedoor universe.

Inhabitants of Baedoor are descendants of jitadians, and as such they are great sailors, invested in technology and trade, with love to some sophisticated political play and artistry.
Unlike their grandfathers however, Baedoor culture was forged by fiery aristocrats and it tends to get more hermetic, yet the passion built by many aristocratic homes drives the culture towards new discoveries and conquests.
Currently, Baedoor civilisation is considered as one of the most technologically advanced in whole universe, but it is politically weakened because of Empire fall during Old Era ending.
'''
races__kaerian_descr = '''
Human race is known to be flexible and very adaptive to its environment. One of common qualities of humans is their mobility and openness to chances, making them overall great merchants and spokeperson, classic fighters, as well as technicians and mages.
What this race gains from being very fluid however, it loses on mastery. Human beings are rarely beyond bit-above-average in many aspects.
Despite those shortcomings, their assimilation skills let them be very expansive kind, inhabiting most of places in Baedoor universe.

Kaer humans are known to be inhabitants of Kaer, dark lands on the south of Baedoor. They count both Serj and those with serj blood from mixed marriages with Baedoor occupants or other races living in Kaer.
Serj built their unique civilisation in forests alongside kehts, keeping mostly north part of the island. Their history is tainted with many wars, mostly with kehts, which really depleted their military strength.
Since beginning, serjs were ere very talented in processing mined goods and craft of wooden and clay furniture. They fought with savage fury, gaining advantage even with very poor equipment.
Nowadays, serj population is much smaller than it used to be, but free of Empire's chains, they slowly come back to their old power, trying to restitute their historical cities near eastern mountain range.
'''
races__jitadian_descr = '''
Human race is known to be flexible and very adaptive to its environment. One of common qualities of humans is their mobility and openness to chances, making them overall great merchants and spokeperson, classic fighters, as well as technicians and mages.
What this race gains from being very fluid however, it loses on mastery. Human beings are rarely beyond bit-above-average in many aspects.
Despite those shortcomings, their assimilation skills let them be very expansive kind, inhabiting most of places in Baedoor universe.

Jitadians are skilled technicians and sailors, known for being forefront of tech advancements in oldest times. Perceived to be excellent gunsmiths, creating highest quality firearms at their time, they established classic equipment for various armies.
It is believed that jitadians were the first to even advance their technology to use gunpowder, founding gunsmithing industry alongside quite differently built ghloddish tech.
While Jitado country weakened in international significance during Old Era, it is still considered as one of the most influential to this day, most noticeably because of its wide-spread trading routes.
Jitadians tend to invest heavily in economy, which makes Jitado one of the most prosperous places since beginning of times, being resilient even in times of crisis.
'''
races__mesinpean_descr = '''
Human race is known to be flexible and very adaptive to its environment. One of common qualities of humans is their mobility and openness to chances, making them overall great merchants and spokeperson, classic fighters, as well as technicians and mages.
What this race gains from being very fluid however, it loses on mastery. Human beings are rarely beyond bit-above-average in many aspects.
Despite those shortcomings, their assimilation skills let them be very expansive kind, inhabiting most of places in Baedoor universe.

Mesinpeans are considered to be the oldest human culture, living in one of the most diverse environment that Mes Inpea island offers.
In times of Pre Era empires rise to power, Mes Inpea was considered one of two most powerful civilisations to rule, alongside Ghloddish Empire. Together with Jitado, they made Old Continent a symbol of prospering realm.
While mesinpeans do not possess any specific traits when it comes to military or magic, they are great workers, exceeding other human civilisations in diversity and average quality of their craftmanship.
Mesinpean culture in general was very influential on later human civilisations, being their strongest mark of impact during their golden era.
'''
races__mrran_descr = '''
Human race is known to be flexible and very adaptive to its environment. One of common qualities of humans is their mobility and openness to chances, making them overall great merchants and spokeperson, classic fighters, as well as technicians and mages.
What this race gains from being very fluid however, it loses on mastery. Human beings are rarely beyond bit-above-average in many aspects.
Despite those shortcomings, their assimilation skills let them be very expansive kind, inhabiting most of places in Baedoor universe.

Eimr may be considered as the most tense land in whole universe, being constantly torn by conflicts, either of internal or external nature.
Unfortunate enough to have lived under multiple occupations, Eimr inhabitants also tend to get into wars and tensions between their own tribes, as mrran civilisation is bundled out of multiple cultures living near each other.
The fact that lands of Eimr are rather poor and desolate doesn't help, as many resolve into thievery and mugging. Eimr is shattered into many self-claimed territories, even in modern days, where united country was achieved.
All those tensions make mrrans very versatile, as they needed to learn their paths of life through individual experience.
'''
races__nordwinians_descr = '''
Human race is known to be flexible and very adaptive to its environment. One of common qualities of humans is their mobility and openness to chances, making them overall great merchants and spokeperson, classic fighters, as well as technicians and mages.
What this race gains from being very fluid however, it loses on mastery. Human beings are rarely beyond bit-above-average in many aspects.
Despite those shortcomings, their assimilation skills let them be very expansive kind, inhabiting most of places in Baedoor universe.

Nordwinians are inhabitants of northern islands, two of which are part of Baedoor continent, and the rest is located further north, on their own archipelago.
Nordwinian culture is visibly influenced by their ancestors who also colonised Baedoor island and northern parts of Moon continent, giving birth to nomathian tribes. Depending on location, their symbolics and architecture changed, adapting to influences of neighbouring civilisations.
However, the prevailing symbol of nordwinians themselves - axe and fur - stayed intact. Despite them, they quite often adapted fighting with long swords and chainmails, especially those who settled in warmer regions.
Being experienced with foresty lands of their origin, nordwinians are also experts when it comes to wood use, creating furniture and many detailed artworks with their high dedication to carpentry.
Nordwinians are dedicated to tradition, cultivating community rituals and celebrate them with feasts. They are known for many festival hold during the year.
'''
races__ormath_descr = '''
Ormath race is quite odd race of short, grayskinned beings living in tribes on Arennan desert. They are heavily structured in their hierarchical societies built around Elders and most importantly, Shaman being the guide of whole tribe.
They also perform many daily activities in groups, either of families and friends, or whole tribe. This community focus is one of recurring qualities of ormath race.
Aside of that, ormaths are used to harsh environment, which resulted in them getting strong immunity system and survival abilities.

Faith makes huge part of ormath's life, however unlike structured religions, this race connects to the wind being natural occurence on Arennan desert. Shamans are sometimes called as "those who knows tongue of winds".
Ormaths believe wind is a driving force of all spirits, guiding souls of those who passed away, and bringing new beings to life.
There are many spirits in ormaths demonology, which also explains why shamans are considered as protective mediators, often calming down those spirits that try to bring chaos to the tribe, sometimes even by literal fight with the element.
'''
races__ghlodd_descr = '''
Ghlodd race is considered as one of the oldest ones in the universe. Existing since world's birth, they lived under the surface of their enormous deserty continent, Seiteh, cultivating their rich artistic traditions and religion.
As legends tell us, they were lead by Guiding God to the surface, leaving their lenghty cave systems in most cases, in favour of surface world.

Ghlodds are weird, deformed creatures, consisting of huge face and barely any limbs to interact with outside, with existing ones being either malformed, short ones, or non-existent.
What they lack in body, however, they more than make up on their psyche. Ghlodds make one of the wisest and most intelligent races, being both great technologists and magicians.
They often try to use that to benefit their lacking bodies, overcoming that to great lengths - oldest centuries are known for Ghloddish Empire being one of the most powerful forces known, conquering many surrounding lands.

Ghlodds are hot-headed and loving war, but they also value highly their social values, such as religion, community and family. They find spirituality to be the most enriching aspect of the world, making them huge advocates for art of any kind.
Their traditions are highly rooted in societal system that seems very odd to foreigners, making ghloddish culture feel hermetic until it is analysed more in-depth through books or simple talk with Seiteh inhabitants.
'''
races__lunatri_descr = '''
Tri race is one of the oldest races in universe, with their origin being unknown. Some people claim that they were the ones to be first sentient lives and all other races evolved from them, either by deforming or transforming.
That claim however is rarely brought, as they share a lot of differences with other races and it wouldn't be likely without mass gods interventions for it to happen.
All tris are considered as bright and skilled in variety of works, but also proficient in magic. Tris are known to be most influencial mages, often preferring very theatrical ways to perform rituals.
They are known for their love of art, theatre and traditions of similar character.

Lunatris are tris living on West Moon, enormous island consisting of many tri clans spread across. Despite efforts to unite them - which partially succeeded - they are very bound to their specific community.

Despite that characteristics, not many lunatris travel outside of Moon Islands territory, sticking to their motherland.
'''

Voitri are descendants of Voitori clan that left Moon continent in times of Pre-Era. Those tris landed on Rossevette island and began forming their own form of tri culture.
They value honour above anything else and also are interested in more chaotic forms of magic, making them much more dangerous warriors than any other tri kind.
While being more militaristic, their interests in art and other fields of culture doesn't differ heavily - they still find a lot of joy in studying and discovering.
Unlike lunatris, they are often very happy to travel to foreign lands, often as mercenaries or guides.
'''
races__saphtri_descr = '''
Tri race is one of the oldest races in universe, with their origin being unknown. Some people claim that they were the ones to be first sentient lives and all other races evolved from them, either by deforming or transforming.

They are known for their love of art, theatre and traditions of similar character.

Saphtri is desert kind of tri and are much more versed in technology than other tris. However, unlike humans, saphtric tech is focused on manipulating mechanical compositions and could be even understood as form of art.
From tools to machines, saphtric tech is often using physical abilities of materials to the extreme, making them unique and difficult to be trained on for those who are used to classic form of technology.
Saphtris are much more strange than their peers from other lands and their culture is found to be hermetic, preserving a bit different kind of religious practices and cultural heritage.
'''
races__pahtri_descr = '''
Tri race is one of the oldest races in universe, with their origin being unknown. Some people claim that they were the ones to be first sentient lives and all other races evolved from them, either by deforming or transforming.

They are known for their love of art, theatre and traditions of similar character.

Pahtris are quite obscure tri kind, living on archipelagos on the west of Rossevette. It is quite unclear when they arrived there, and it is even theoretised they migrated from West Moon much before any tris tried to.
They differ heavily from all other tris, being shorter and much more tribalic in their behaviour.
Despite their appearance and culture being so unlike tris, they share similarities in abilities and love to traditions, however the latter is also vastly separate.
Pahtris were the only race to not be under Baedoor Empire ruling per se, as despite being conquered, Karos Archipelago were never occupied militarily. Pahtris were offered a lot of sovereignty, which let them preserve their culture intact.
